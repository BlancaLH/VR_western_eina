# Western Eina

Western Eina is a VR application intended for performing a change blindness experiment, in which the players are focused on shooting arrows to a cowboy while big changes are happening in the scene. The possible changes are the following:

- Adding elements to the scene.
- Removing elements from the scene.
- Switching positions of two elements.
- Moving existing elements of the scene.

With this project we are able to see if users are able to detect those changes while they are playing and also to measure how they react when those happen. For further details, please refer to the paper.

This project was developed by [Blanca Lasheras Hernández](https://github.com/BlancaLH) and [Iñigo Gabirondo López](https://github.com/igabirondo16), for the Virtual Reality course of the [Master Program in Robotics, Graphics and Computer Vision](https://eina.unizar.es/mrgcv).
